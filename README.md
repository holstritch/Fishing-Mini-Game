# Fishing-Mini-Game
Made using Sumo's Playbuffer Framework during the Diversity and Inclusion Internship.

A cosy fishing game inspired by the fishing mechanics in Stardew Valley.

Catch fish to increase your score and unlock new species to catch.

The fish which add more to your score are harder to catch.

To win the game, first unlock all the fish and finally catch the rare golden fish!
